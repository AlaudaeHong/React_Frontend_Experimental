# Yun Hong

Hi, this is Yun Hong. I am currently pursuing M.S. in ECE at CMU. My
concentration is in System (Embedded, Networking, and
HPC/Distributed). But I have a growing interest in web technology
(The beauty of "One page works everywhere"). I will graduate in 2022
Spring. I am looking for a SDE job in system/backend/frontend field
after my graduation.

## Education

## Research/Work Experience (Full History)

### 2019 Jan - 2019 May, as a Programmer

-   Working under supervision of Prof. Meng Wang and her PhDs to implement a Error Correction Algorithm in C#.
-   Rely on multi-threading to improve I/O throughput and CPU utility.
-   Therefore, reducing total running time from over a day to around 3 mins.
