# Yun Hong

Hi, this is Yun Hong. I am currently pursuing M.S. in ECE at CMU. My
concentration is in System (Embedded, Networking, and
HPC/Distributed). But I have a growing interest in web technology
(The beauty of "One page works everywhere"). I will graduate in 2022
Spring. I am looking for a SDE job in system/backend field
after my graduation.

## Education

-   2021-2022 **Master's** in _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ at **_Carnegie Mellon Universiyt_**
-   2016-2020 **Bachelor's** in _Computer & System Engineering_ and _Electrical Engineering_ (Dual Degree) at **_Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute_**

### @**_CMU_**

-   **18709/15719 - Advanced Cloud Computing**

    -   **Project 1 - Advanced Auto-Scaling on AWS**

        -   Part1: Write a tereform to provision resources, and utilize cloudwatch to autoscaling resource.
            -   Autoscaing based on RPS measured by Load Balencer, or request per second.
            -   Measure the workload that one VM can handle without too much latency.
        -   Part2: Custumized cloudwatch of monitor reading send from the application.
            -   Autoscaing based on RPS measured by application, or request per second.
            -   Measure the workload that one VM can handle without too much latency.
        -   Part3: Serverless application, letting AWS to handle autoscaling.
            -   Configure just-enough resource for AWS Lambda Function
            -   Limit max number of VM that running this Lambda function

    -   **Project 2 - Data Engineering on the Cloud**

        -   Part1&2: Write and optimize a Spark Program that does ETL
            -   Use RDD to store data.
            -   Use broadcast to reduce overhead introduced when give each partition shared resources they need.
            -   Use profiling provided by PySpark to analyze the bottleneck of program
            -   Remove/Combine redundant procedure
        -   Part3: Efficient iterative machine learning training.
            -   Partition data to allow parallelism
            -   Use inverted indices to combine features with its partiton
            -   Call relatively inexpensive actions, `count`, to force Spark to evaluate DAG
            -   Use Join to avoid OOM (Out of Memory) Error. Since there are too many features to fit in memory of single machine if using boardcast.

    -   **Project 3 - Resource scheduling in Kubernetes**
        -   Part1: Write a Kubernetes scheduler extender
            -   Use predication to filter pods that cannot be used for current job.
            -   Use priority to priorize jobs so that each job can get best resource under current situation
            -   Avoid blocking by making a machine a "express lane": only fast jobs can run on it
        -   Part2&3: Write job scheduling policies with Kubernetes
            -   Analyze FIFO with random resource allocation.
            -   Analyze FIFO with heterogeneous awareness.
            -   Analyze SJF with heterogeneous awareness.
            -   Design custom policy provides better resource utilization: run jobs that yields best performance per machine
